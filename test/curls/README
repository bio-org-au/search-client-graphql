Created to test changes to display formats.

The idea is to record a large sample of current output via curls, then compare after-change outputs to those originals.


Steps

1. Make code changes
2. cd test/curls
2. bash ./curls
3. bash ./run-diffs | tee diffs.log
4. Review the diff output.  The run-diffs script tries to remove spurious differences like time stamps and meta codes.



Also, see the archive of old orig files.
