Created to test changes to display formats.

The idea is to record a large sample of current output via curls, then compare after-change outputs to those originals.


Steps

1. Make code changes
2. cd test/curls
2. bash ./curls
3. bash ./diffs
4. Review the diff output.  There will be spurious differences like time stamps and meta codes.
